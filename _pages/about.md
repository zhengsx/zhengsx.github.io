His representative works include:

1. Graphormer [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/)]: the first general-purpose Transformer for graph data, which won the 1st place of KDD Cup 2021 OGB-LSC challenge [[link](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)] [[technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08279)] and the 1st Open Catalyst Challenge [[link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v176/das22a/das22a.pdf)], outperforming teams from Google DeepMind, Meta AI Research, and others.
2. Distributional Graphormer (DiG) [[demo](https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05445)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/distributional-graphormer-toward-equilibrium-distribution-prediction-for-molecular-systems/)]: a breakthrough model that goes beyond AlphaFold2 by predicting the equilibrium distribution of protein structures, rather than a single structure. DiG is also a disruptive innovation in statistical mechanics, where it uses generative AI technology to revolutionize traditional molecular dynamics simulation or sampling methods.
3. DeepRSM [[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c02923)]: a joint work with the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, which developed an AI numerical model for regional air quality and climate modeling, and was adopted by China’s “14th Five-Year Plan” as the core technology for controlling air pollution and carbon emission in China.
