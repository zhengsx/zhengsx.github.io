Dr. Shuxin Zheng graduated from the MSRA-USTC Joint PhD Program. He currently serves as the Deputy Director of Zhongguancun Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Director of the Strategic Planning Office at the Beijing Zhongguancun Academy, Enterprise Mentor at Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Associate Editor of "[AI for Science](https://www.materialsfutures.org/ai-for-science)" journal. Previously, he was a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and Head of Microsoft Scientific Foundation Models. He has won multiple world championships in artificial intelligence and trained the largest scientific foundation model to date. Dr. Zheng has published over 20 first-author and corresponding-author papers in Nature subsidiary journals and top international AI conferences, with more than 5,000 citations. He serves as a visiting lecturer at Tsinghua University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Microsoft AI Academy, where he has long taught courses such as "Fundamentals of Machine Learning Methods and Applications" and "Advanced Machine Learning."

His representative works include:

1. Graphormer [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/)]: the first general-purpose Transformer for graph data, which won the 1st place of KDD Cup 2021 OGB-LSC challenge [[link](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)] [[technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08279)] and the 1st Open Catalyst Challenge [[link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v176/das22a/das22a.pdf)], outperforming teams from Google DeepMind, Meta AI Research, and others.
2. General Graphormer (GeG): the world’s largest foundation model (with 22 billion parameters) for molecular science, which can perform multiple scientific tasks across different domains and scales, and serve as a powerful scientific assistant for accelerating scientific discovery.
3. Distributional Graphormer (DiG) [[demo](https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05445)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/distributional-graphormer-toward-equilibrium-distribution-prediction-for-molecular-systems/)]: a breakthrough model that goes beyond AlphaFold2 by predicting the equilibrium distribution of protein structures, rather than a single structure. DiG is also a disruptive innovation in statistical mechanics, where it uses generative AI technology to revolutionize traditional molecular dynamics simulation or sampling methods.
4. DeepRSM [[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c02923)]: a joint work with the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, which developed an AI numerical model for regional air quality and climate modeling, and was adopted by China’s “14th Five-Year Plan” as the core technology for controlling air pollution and carbon emission in China.
