Dr. Shuxin Zheng is an Associate Professor at Beijing Zhongguancun Academy and serves as Deputy Director of the Zhongguancun Institute of Artificial Intelligence. He directs the General AI & Agents research track within the AI Fundamentals Department at Beijing Zhongguancun Academy and holds an appointment as Enterprise Mentor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. His research focuses on artificial general intelligence, generative artificial intelligence, and their applications to computational science and scientific discovery. His scholarly contributions have been featured on the cover of *Science* and published in leading venues including *Nature Machine Intelligence*, *Nature Computational Science*, *Nature Cell Biology*, and premier conferences such as *ICML*, *ICLR*, and *NeurIPS*, with over 5,000 citations indexed by Google Scholar. Dr. Zheng serves on the editorial board of *AI for Science* as Associate Editor and maintains active peer review responsibilities for top-tier AI journals and conferences. He earned his Ph.D. in 2019 through the joint doctoral program between Microsoft Research Asia and the University of Science and Technology of China, following his B.S. degree from USTC in 2014. Prior to his current position, he held the role of Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and has achieved recognition through multiple championships in international artificial intelligence competitions.

His representative works include:

1. Graphormer [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/)]: the first general-purpose Transformer for graph data, which won the 1st place of KDD Cup 2021 OGB-LSC challenge [[link](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)] [[technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08279)] and the 1st Open Catalyst Challenge [[link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v176/das22a/das22a.pdf)], outperforming teams from Google DeepMind, Meta AI Research, and others.
2. Distributional Graphormer (DiG) [[demo](https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05445)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/distributional-graphormer-toward-equilibrium-distribution-prediction-for-molecular-systems/)]: a breakthrough model that goes beyond AlphaFold2 by predicting the equilibrium distribution of protein structures, rather than a single structure. DiG is also a disruptive innovation in statistical mechanics, where it uses generative AI technology to revolutionize traditional molecular dynamics simulation or sampling methods.
3. DeepRSM [[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c02923)]: a joint work with the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, which developed an AI numerical model for regional air quality and climate modeling, and was adopted by China’s “14th Five-Year Plan” as the core technology for controlling air pollution and carbon emission in China.
