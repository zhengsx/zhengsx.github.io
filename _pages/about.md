Dr. Shuxin Zheng (郑书新), a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, serves as an Industrial Adjunct Lecturer at Chinese Academy of Sciences and is the Lead for Microsoft's scientific foundation models. He has won multiple world championships in artificial intelligence and has trained the largest scientific foundation model to date. He has published over 20 papers in top-tier scientific journals and AI conferences like Nature Computational Science, and Nature Machine Intelligence, accumulating over 3000 citations. Dr. Zheng regularly serves as a reviewer for premier AI conferences and journals, and as a guest lecturer at Tsinghua University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Microsoft AI Academy, teaching general courses like "Foundations of Machine Learning Methods and Applications" and "Advanced Machine Learning."

His representative works include:

1. Graphormer [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/)]: the first general-purpose Transformer for graph data, which won the 1st place of KDD Cup 2021 OGB-LSC challenge [[link](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)] [[technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08279)] and the 1st Open Catalyst Challenge [[link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v176/das22a/das22a.pdf)], outperforming teams from Google DeepMind, Meta AI Research, and others.
2. General Graphormer (GeG): the world’s largest foundation model (with 22 billion parameters) for molecular science, which can perform multiple scientific tasks across different domains and scales, and serve as a powerful scientific assistant for accelerating scientific discovery.
3. Distributional Graphormer (DiG) [[demo](https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05445)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/distributional-graphormer-toward-equilibrium-distribution-prediction-for-molecular-systems/)]: a breakthrough model that goes beyond AlphaFold2 by predicting the equilibrium distribution of protein structures, rather than a single structure. DiG is also a disruptive innovation in statistical mechanics, where it uses generative AI technology to revolutionize traditional molecular dynamics simulation or sampling methods.
4. DeepRSM [[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c02923)]: a joint work with the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, which developed an AI numerical model for regional air quality and climate modeling, and was adopted by China’s “14th Five-Year Plan” as the core technology for controlling air pollution and carbon emission in China.

郑书新博士，微软研究院首席研究员，中科院企业导师，微软科学基础模型负责人，多项人工智能世界冠军，并训练了迄今最大的科学大模型。郑书新博士在《自然》大子刊及顶级国际人工智能会议发表一作和通讯论文20余篇，学术引用超过3000次，并长期担任国际顶级AI会议与期刊审稿人。郑书新研究员在清华大学、中科院和微软人工智能学院等担任客座讲师，长期讲授《机器学习方法与应用基础》和《高等机器学习》等课程。
