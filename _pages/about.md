Dr. Shuxin Zheng (郑书新) is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, where he leads the Scientific Foundation Model project. He obtained his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014 and 2019, respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) and [Prof. Nenghai Yu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynh/). He joined Microsoft Research as a researcher in 2019, and was promoted to senior researcher in 2021 and principal researcher in 2023. His research interests span general AI and generative AI, and their applications in scientific domains. He has published more than 20 papers on top-tier AI or scientific venues, and received over 2000 citations [[scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rPhGUw0AAAAJ&hl=en)]. He is also an adjunct lecturer at Tsinghua University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Microsoft AI School, where he teaches “Machine Learning Methods and Application Fundamentals” and “Advanced Machine Learning”.

His representative works include:

1. Graphormer [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05234.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/)]: the first general-purpose Transformer for graph data, which won the 1st place of KDD Cup 2021 OGB-LSC challenge [[link](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)] [[technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08279)] and the 1st Open Catalyst Challenge [[link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v176/das22a/das22a.pdf)], outperforming teams from Google DeepMind, Meta AI Research, and others.
2. General Graphormer (GeG): the world’s largest foundation model (with 22 billion parameters) for molecular science, which can perform multiple scientific tasks across different domains and scales, and serve as a powerful scientific assistant for accelerating scientific discovery.
3. Distributional Graphormer (DiG) [[demo](https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05445)] [[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/distributional-graphormer-toward-equilibrium-distribution-prediction-for-molecular-systems/)]: a breakthrough model that goes beyond AlphaFold2 by predicting the equilibrium distribution of protein structures, rather than a single structure. DiG is also a disruptive innovation in statistical mechanics, where it uses generative AI technology to revolutionize traditional molecular dynamics simulation or sampling methods.
4. DeepRSM [[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c02923)]: a joint work with the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, which developed an AI numerical model for regional air quality and climate modeling, and was adopted by China’s “14th Five-Year Plan” as the core technology for controlling air pollution and carbon emission in China.

郑书新博士于微软研究院担任首席研究员一职，并领导科学基础模型研究项目。他的研究兴趣涵盖通用AI与生成式AI，以及它们在科学领域的应用。他带领团队多次在科学智能(AI for Science)主题的 国际竞赛中夺冠，并在顶级人工智能或科学期刊上发表20余篇论文，引用超过2000次。郑书新研究员长期担任国际顶级AI会议与期刊审稿人，并在清华大学、中科院和微软人工智能学院等担任客座讲师，讲授《机器学习方法与应用基础》和《高等机器学习》课程。
